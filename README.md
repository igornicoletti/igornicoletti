I’m a Front-End Developer focused on building modern, high-quality web applications using React and TypeScript. I value clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

Experienced in:
• Building robust applications with Vite, React Router, and Firebase.
• Managing server state efficiently with React Query for optimized data fetching, caching, and mutations.
• Creating accessible and reusable component systems using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
• Implementing reusable code patterns with custom Hooks for complex logic, data handling, and form submission.
• Ensuring code quality through automated testing with Vitest and strict linting using ESLint and TypeScript.
