I am a passionate software developer focused on creating modern web applications with an emphasis on performance, clean architecture, and code quality. My goal is to transform complex ideas into elegant and functional solutions.

### 🚀 My Stack and Development Philosophy

I believe in using the right tools to build efficient and scalable products. My development environment is based on the following technologies and standards:

### 🛠️ Core Technologies
* **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite
* **Backend & Data:** Firebase and **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state management.
* **UI & Styling:** **Radix UI** for accessible components and **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling.
* **Routing:** React Router
* **Testing:** Vitest for unit and integration tests.

### 🏛️ Architecture and Patterns
* **Abstracted Data Management:** I create custom hooks to centralize and simplify data-fetching logic.
* **Robust Forms:** I use **React Hook Form** with schema validation via **Zod**, ensuring data security and consistency.
* **Secure Authentication:** I implement authentication flows with protected routes.
* **Organized Codebase:** I structure my projects with a clear separation of responsibilities in directories like `/hooks`, `/services`, `/providers`, and `/lib`.

### ✅ Quality and Tooling
* **Consistent Code:** I use **ESLint** with strict, type-aware configurations to ensure clean and error-free code.
* **Development Environment:** I use **pnpm** as my package manager and **JSON Server** for mocking APIs during development.
